**TeX Live 2016 has been frozen since May 16th 2017** *No more updates for it forever.*

Thank you and good bye, TeX Live 2016, Welcome [docker-texlive-2017](https://github.com/shuichiro-makigaki/docker-texlive-2017)!

# Dockerfile for TeX Live 2016

This is a Dockerfile repository of TeX Live 2016 with scheme-full profile. (Almost) monthly updated.

# Usage

A path to TeX Live scripts and binaries (`/usr/local/texlive/2016/bin/x86_64-linux`) is already added to `$PATH`.

``` shell
$ docker run --rm -i -t makisyu/texlive-2016 platex
This is e-pTeX, Version 3.14159265-p3.7-160201-2.6 (utf8.euc) (TeX Live 2016) (preloaded format=platex)
 restricted \write18 enabled.
**
! End of file on the terminal... why?
```

Most users want to add a volume that contains source codes and change working directory to it.

``` shell
$ ls
main.tex
$ docker run --rm --volume $PWD:/workdir --workdir /workdir makisyu/texlive-2016 platex main.tex
```

Docker volume is mounted as `uid=1000,gid=1000` (In most cases, these ids mean `root:root`.), and files in the directories are owned by root. Adding `--user` option is good idea.

You should use uid/gid instead of user/group names because, in the container, `/etc/passwd` doesn't contain your user/group names. If you use `uid:gid`, the container creates files as specified `uid:gid` without reading `/etc/passwd`.

``` shell
$ docker run --rm --volume $PWD:/workdir --workdir /workdir --user 1001:1001 makisyu/texlive-2016 platex main.tex
```

`latexmk`? Yes, it's very useful, and scheme-full profile includes huge collection of other useful tools.

``` shell
$ ls -a
.latexmkrc main.tex
$ docker run --rm --volume $PWD:/workdir --workdir /workdir --user 1001:1001 makisyu/texlive-2016 latexmk
```

This image is based on fedora:latest. Shell and other basic utilities are available, and you can run shell script, perl, etc.

``` shell
$ docker run -i -t --rm --volume $PWD:/workdir --workdir /workdir --user 1001:1001 makisyu/texlive-2016 /usr/bin/bash
[root@20629bec6417 workdir]# ls
main.tex
[root@20629bec6417 workdir]# perl -v

This is perl 5, version 24, subversion 1 (v5.24.1) built for x86_64-linux-thread-multi
(with 68 registered patches, see perl -V for more detail)

Ooops. I know!
